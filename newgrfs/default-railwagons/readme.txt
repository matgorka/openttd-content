Default railwagons
====================

Version: 1

# Description

An OpenGFX+ Industries fix, adds default food vans and fruit trucks (from sub-arctic and
sub-tropical climates) to the temperate climate. Restores grain hoppers to sub-arctic and
sub-tropical climates (without the fix wheat and maize are stored in coal trucks and copper
ore hoppers respectively).
